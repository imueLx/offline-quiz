  "answer": "The client should avoid getting pregnant for 3 months after the vaccine because the vaccine has teratogenic effects",
  "rationale": "The client must understand that she must not become pregnant for 3 months after the vaccination because of its potential teratogenic effects. The rubella vaccine is made from duck eggs so an allergic reaction may occur in clients with egg allergies. The virus is not transmitted into the breast milk, so clients may continue to breastfeed after the vaccination. Transient arthralgia and rash are common adverse effects of the vaccine."
